# NYC CitiBike Analysis with Tableau Public
[link to story]https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/landon.tatro/viz/NYC-CitiBike-Story/NYCCItiBikeChallengeStory

## Purpose
The analysis was performed to understand the basic operation of CitiBikes in New York City. The gathered information would then be used to create predictions on how a similar business would perform in Des Moines, Iowa. The analysis did not look into the financial aspect, only gathered information including, but not limited to, bike usage, average trip duration, gender, and if the user was subscribed or not. Des Moines was not examined in this case.

## Results
Results are based on the following visuals:
  - Visual 1 (Bike Checkout Length): The majority of rides had trip durations under 25 minutes. The number of rides diminished as time went on, but some went for almost 24 hours.
  - Visual 2 (Bike Checkout Length by Gender): The chart follows a similar pattern for both genders, but it is evident that most riders are male.
  - Visual 3 (Weekday Trips - Hourly): During the work week, the most activity was during commute times (6am-9am and 4pm-8pm). Weekends are strong activity in the middle of the day.
  - Visual 4 (Weekday Trips by Gender - Hourly): Male and female riders followed the same pattern as visual 3, but accounts with unknown gender saw more activity on the weekend, rather than the work week.
  - Visual 5 (Weekday Trips by Gender - User Type): Most male and female riders are subscribed, whereas unspecified accounts are almost entirely unsubscribed.
  - Visual 6 (Bike Usage by ID): The chart shows a vast difference between bikes that have many trips versus bikes that logged very few. This did not account for time each bike was ridden.
  - Visual 7 (August Peak Usage Hours): Most activity is during daylight hours, with minimal traffic between 1am and 5am. The commute times also see increased activity.

## Summary
According to the data, males took 2.6 times more rides than females. Next, it would be valuable to see how their average trip duration varied. There must be a reason females do not ride the bikes - perhaps a poll could help us uncover if it is a safety concern or simply not an interest. It is also important to note that commute times see the most activity across the board, though this may be due to NYC traffic. Des Moines is not the same city, and thus should consider many factors and how they differ from the anaylzed location. The bike usage chart helps the user see how bikes are disproportionately ridden. This is key in locating areas of high demand that may need more bicycles or, on the other hand, help locate areas that have an overabundance of bikes available (serving as inefficient capital). The hours between 1am and 5am could be used for bicycle maintenance, especially for the high demand areas.

Going forward, these charts would benefit the analysis:
  - Average trip duration based on gender
  - A heatmap separating unsubscribed and subscribed users - to potentially map tourist routes
  - Monthly usage charts, with heatmaps to coincide
